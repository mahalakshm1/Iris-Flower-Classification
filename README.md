# Iris-Flower-Classification
- Iris Flower Classification

A simple Machine Learning project that classifies iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on their sepal and petal dimensions using the Iris dataset.

- Project Overview:
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning.  
This project demonstrates the basic workflow of a classification task:
. Loading and exploring data  
. Preprocessing  
. Splitting data into training and testing sets  
. Training a classification model  
. Evaluating its accuracy  

- Algorithms Used
  we can use or experiment with various models such as:
. Logistic Regression  
. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
. Decision Tree Classifier  
. Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
. Random Forest Classifier
